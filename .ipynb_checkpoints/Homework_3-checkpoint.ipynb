In fact, we could consider document cosine similarity as a good starting point to be enhanced with a new normalized index (to maintain consistency and still being able to compare the old and new ranks).\n",

    "Hence, we are going to ask user's preferred geographical position (city name) and, after computing the distances between user's position and each room ads. Considering that there's a inverse correlation between distance and the way we deal with ranking. On one hand, the higher the rank (cosine) is, the better it is. On the other hand, the lower the distance is, the better it is. For this reason, we're going to invert the normalized index obtained through distance calculations.\n",
